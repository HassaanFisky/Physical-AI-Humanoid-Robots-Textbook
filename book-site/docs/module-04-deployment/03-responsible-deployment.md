# Responsible Deployment (Safety, Ethics, Reliability)

> **Why this matters:** Robots sharing space with humans brings massive responsibility. A bug isn't just a crash; it's an injury.

## Safety Standards

- **ISO 13482**: Safety requirements for personal care robots.
- **Functional Safety**: Redundancy. If the main PC crashes, a "safety core" (MCU) must lock the joints or damp them.

## Ethics of Humanoid AI

1.  **Displacement**: Will this replace jobs? (Yes, likely dull/dangerous ones first).
2.  **Affection**: Humans bond with humanoids. Is it ethical to simulate emotions to manipulate users?
3.  **Dual Use**: Every rescue robot is a potential soldier.

## Reliability Engineering

- **Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)**: How long until a gear strips?
- **Fail-Safe Design**: When power is lost, does it collapse dangerously or sag gently? (Knees should buckle, not lock).

## Key Takeaways

- Safety is the #1 priority.
- Respect the psychological impact of human-like machines.
- Design for failure—because it _will_ fail.
