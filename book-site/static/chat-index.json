    "text": "At its core, a Physical AI system operates in a continuous loop. It is not just \"input -> output\", but \"observation -> action -> state change -> observation\". Key Components 1. Perception: Converting raw sensor data (pixels, currents, lidar points) into a semantic understanding of the world. 2. Planning: Deciding what to do next (e.g., \"Step forward\", \"Grab the cup\"). 3. Control: Deciding how to execute that plan (e.g., \"Apply 5Nm torque to knee joint\").",

    "text": "Physical AI implies embodiment. The intelligence is constrained by the body. A 50kg robot cannot stop instantly. A hand with 3 fingers grasps differently than one with 5. The software must understand the hardware. Common Pitfalls - Latency Ignoring: In software, a 500ms delay is annoying. In robotics, it causes falling over. - Model Mismatch: Your physics simulation is never 100% accurate to the real world. - Safety: A bad LLM output prints text. A bad robot output breaks a leg (or yours).",
